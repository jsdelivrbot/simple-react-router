# Simple React Router Example

Based off my [Simple React Example](https://github.com/mcrice123/simple-react-example) and the boilerplate from Stephen Grider's [ReduxSimpleStarter](https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReduxSimpleStarter)

Also used this resource for better understanding of routing: [React Training](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/example/basic)

Interested in learning [React](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/)?
